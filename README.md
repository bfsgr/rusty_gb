# Rusty GB - Gameboy Emulator
This is a side project I decided to make to learn Rust and more about emulation and OS's. This project doesn't aim to be optimized or accurate.
## What's working
- [X] CPU
- [X] GPU
- [X] Timer
- [ ] Sound
- [X] Joypad
- [X] MCB1
- [X] MCB2
- [X] MCB3 (still without timer)
- [ ] MCB5

## Accuracy 
* [blargg-gb](https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) cpu_instrs tests
* [blargg-gb](https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) halt bug test
