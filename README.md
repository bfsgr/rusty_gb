# Rusty GB - Gameboy Emulator
This is a side project I decided to make to learn Rust and more about emulation and OS's. This project doesn't aim to be optimized or acuterate.
## What's working
- [X] CPU
- [X] GPU
- [X] Timer
- [X] Sound Controller
- [X] Joypad
- [X] MCB1 (Only battery support missing)
- [ ] MCB2

## Accuracy 
* Pass all [blargg-gb](https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) cpu_instrs tests
* Pass [blargg-gb](https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) halt bug test
* Pass [blargg-gb](https://gbdev.gg8.se/files/roms/blargg-gb-tests/) instrs timming tests
